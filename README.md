esri-dump
=========

A Node module to assist with pulling data out of an ESRI ArcGIS REST server into a more useful format.

This is based on [Python code](http://github.com/iandees/esri-dump) I wrote to do the same thing.

```sh
npm install -g esri-dump

esri-dump http://services2.bhamaps.com/arcgis/rest/services/AGS_jackson_co_il_taxmap/MapServer/0
```
